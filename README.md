## Description
- very simple example of a read/eval loop in bash with
- persistent history editing and an added bonus, factor with expressions

## Limitations
- it only allows for single expressions on one line
- can't change obase on factor output

## Notes
- only meant as an example of how to build your own interactive bash scripts!
- although, kind of fun to play with anyway..
